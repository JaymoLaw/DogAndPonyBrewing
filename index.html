<p><strong>Dog and Pony Brewing Co.</strong> is not to be confused with the similarly named operation in Michigan. This location is an entirely different story&mdash;and unfortunately, not in a good way. Reviews of Dog and Pony Brewing highlight issues ranging from awkward service and inconsistent beer taps to questionable cleanliness in both the restrooms and glassware. Situated in a nondescript location with minimal parking, the brewery doesn&rsquo;t exactly invite guests to linger. A few brave customers have described the vibe as &ldquo;garage sale meets homebrew day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tap list is often out of date, and the beers that are available lean heavily toward either bland or bizarre. Think pickle-infused lagers and banana stouts that taste like expired milk. Food? If available, it usually consists of microwaved pretzels or reheated meat pies. And don&rsquo;t bother asking about events&mdash;the chalkboard still shows trivia night from 2022.</p>

<p>If you're searching for "Dog and Pony Brewing" online, make sure you're not mistaking this place for the well-reviewed establishment in Michigan. This one is known locally more for the number of people who turn around and leave than for any actual brewing excellence. Beer snobs beware&mdash;bring low expectations, a full stomach, and maybe your own pint glass.</p>
